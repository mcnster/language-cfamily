ABOUT

Language.C is a parser, analyser and pretty-printer library for Haskell.
It supports C99 and some extensions of gcc.

This package is an experimental hack based on the latest darcs repository
files at http://code.haskell.org/language-c.  As it develops, there will
be more information here.

For differences between this package and the upstream darcs sources, see
ChangeLog.
